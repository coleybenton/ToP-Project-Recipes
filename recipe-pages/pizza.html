			<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>There's no pizza quite like a barbecue chicken pizza, it's unique. As a bbq connoisseur, I
can guarantee that a bbq chicken pizza made right, is quite a taste and sight.</p>
			
			<h2>Ingredients</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>1/2 homemade/store pizza crust</li>
					<li>1-2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
					<li>1/3 cup + 2 tablespoons BBQ Sauce (the more the merrier)</li>
					<li>1 cup chopped/shredded cooked chicken(about 1-8oz breast)</li>
					<li>2/3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
					<li>2/3 cup shredded smoked gouda cheese</li>
					<li>1/2 cup small red onion, thinly sliced</li>
					<li>fresh cilantro for topping (optional)</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Steps</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Prepare pizza dough through step 5, including preheating the oven to 475°F (246°C). Cover the shaped dough lightly with plastic wrap and allow it to rest as the oven preheats.</li>
					<li>To prevent the pizza toppings from making your pizza crust soggy, brush the shaped dough lightly with olive oil. Using your fingers, push dents into the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Top the dough evenly with 1/3 cup BBQ sauce. Toss the cooked chicken with the remaining BBQ sauce, then scatter all around the pizza. Add the cheeses and red onion.</li>
					<li>Bake pizza for 12-15 minutes. Remove from the oven and top with fresh cilantro, if desired. Slice hot pizza and serve immediately.</li>
					<li>Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator. Reheat as you prefer. Baked pizza slices can be frozen up to 3 months. See pizza crust recipe for instructions on freezing the pizza dough.</li>
				</ol>

			<h2>Notes</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>If not using an instant yeast, rise time may be up to 40% longer.</li>
					<li>If you do not have smoked gouda, replace with the same amount of shredded mozzarella. You can leave off the onion and/or cilantro if desired.</li>
				</ul>
